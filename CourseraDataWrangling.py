#What is Standardization?
#Standardization is the process of transforming data into a common format 
#which allows the researcher to make the meaningful comparison.
#Example
#Transform mpg to L/100km:
#The formula for unit conversion is L/100km = 235 / mpg

df["city-L/100km'"] = 235/df["city-mpg"]
 
df["highway-L/100km'"] = 235/df["highway-mpg"]


#Data Normalization
#Why normalization?
#Normalization is the process of transforming values of several variables into a similar range. 
#Typical normalizations include scaling the variable so the variable average is 0, 
#scaling the variable so the variance is 1, or scaling variable so the variable values range from 0 to 1
#Example
#To demonstrate normalization, let's say we want to scale the columns "length", "width" and "height"
#Target:would like to Normalize those variables so their value ranges from 0 to 1.
#Approach: replace original value by (original value)/(maximum value)


df["length"] = df["length"]/ df["length"].max()
df["width"] = df["width"]/ df["width"].max()
df["height"] = df["height"]/ df["height"].max()


#Binning
#Why binning?
#Binning is a process of transforming continuous numerical variables into 
#discrete categorical 'bins', for grouped analysis.
#Example:
#
#In our dataset, "horsepower" is a real valued variable ranging from 48 to 288, 
#it has 57 unique values. What if we only care about the price difference between cars with high horsepower, 
#medium horsepower, and little horsepower (3 types)? 
#Can we rearrange them into three â€˜bins' to simplify analysis?
#
#We will use the Pandas method 'cut' to segment the 'horsepower' column into 3 bins

df["horsepower"] = df["horsepower"].astype(int)

plt.pyplot.hist(df["horsepower"])
# set x/y labels and plot title
plt.pyplot.xlabel("horsepower")
plt.pyplot.ylabel("count")
plt.pyplot.title("horsepower bins")

#We would like 3 bins of equal size bandwidth so we use numpy's 
#linspace(start_value, end_value, numbers_generated function.
#Since we want to include the minimum value of horsepower we want to set start_value=min(df["horsepower"]).
#Since we want to include the maximum value of horsepower we want to set end_value=max(df["horsepower"]).
#Since we are building 3 bins of equal length, there should be 4 dividers, so numbers_generated=4.


bins = np.linspace(min(df["horsepower"]), max(df["horsepower"]),4)
print(bins)

group_names = ['Low', 'Medium', 'High']

df["horsepower-binned"] = pd.cut(df["horsepower"],bins, labels=group_names , include_lowest = True )
df[['horsepower','horsepower-binned']].head(20)


df["horsepower-binned"].value_counts()

pyplot.bar(group_names, df["horsepower-binned"].value_counts())
plt.pyplot.hist(df["horsepower-binned"])
plt.pyplot.xlabel("horsepower-binned")
plt.pyplot.ylabel("count")
plt.pyplot.title("horsepower binned")


# draw historgram of attribute "horsepower" with bins = 3
plt.pyplot.hist(df["horsepower"], bins = 5 )

# set x/y labels and plot title
plt.pyplot.xlabel("horsepower")
plt.pyplot.ylabel("count")
plt.pyplot.title("horsepower bins")



#Indicator variable (or dummy variable)
#What is an indicator variable?
#An indicator variable (or dummy variable) is a numerical variable used to label categories. 
#They are called 'dummies' because the numbers themselves don't have inherent meaning.
#Why we use indicator variables?
#So we can use categorical variables for regression analysis in the later modules.
#Example
#We see the column "fuel-type" has two unique values, "gas" or "diesel". 
#Regression doesn't understand words, only numbers. To use this attribute in regression analysis,
# we convert "fuel-type" into indicator variables.
#We will use the panda's method 'get_dummies' to assign numerical values to different categories of fuel type.
